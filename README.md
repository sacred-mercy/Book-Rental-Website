INTRODUCTION 

Online Book Rental is a website where the customer can rent books online for a particular duration of time. Through a web browser the customers can search for a book by its title or author, later can add to the shopping cart and can finally rent it for the required time period. A user visiting the website can see a wide range of books arranged in respective categories. The user can login using his account details or new customers can set up an account very quickly. They should give the details of their name, contact number and shipping address. The user can also give feedback to a book by giving reviews and ratings. The books are divided into many categories based on subject Like Software, Database, English etc. Many students find textbooks too expensive to buy at school bookstores and many courses only use the required textbooks a few days in a semester. This becomes very wasteful and frustrating for students & others people. This online bookstore provides a solution to this. It will provide a service in which students can rent books online without any trouble.
The website will be implemented using HTML, JAVASCRIPT and PHP as the programming language.


OBJECTIVE 

•	Main objective is to provide a platform for users to rent books according to their need and for required time period. 
•	To provide a better, feasible, user interactive website where both book giver and book receiver can be facilitated.
