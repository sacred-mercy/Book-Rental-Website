INTRODUCTION

Online Book Rental is a website where the customer can rent books online for a particular duration of time. Through a
web browser the customers can search for a book by its title or author, later can rent it for the required time period.
A user visiting the website can see a wide range of books arranged in respective categories. The user may select desired
book and view its price. The user may even search for specific books on the website. Once the user selects a book, the
user can login using his account details or new customers can set up an account very quickly and rent it. They should
give the details of their name, contact number, Aadhar number verification for security purpose and shipping address.
The books are divided into many categories such as Software, Database, English, novels, comics etc. Many people find
books too expensive to buy for a short period of time and in the case of school/college students many courses only use
the required textbooks a few days in a semester. This becomes very wasteful and frustrating for students. Most comic and
novel readers require them to read once. This online bookstore provides a solution to this.
