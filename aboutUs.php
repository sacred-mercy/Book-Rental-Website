        <strong>Why rent books from Book Rental ?</strong><br>
        Buying books online can be really expensive, especially if you like to read a lot. And that is why, at Book
        Rental, we are committed to provide you a huge collection of books at amazing discounted prices. We are not a
        profit hungry online book renter, but a small book store at the corner of your street. Based out of Dehradun,
        Book Rental was started with an aim to promote reading culture in India, to make reading cool again. Main aim is
        to bring down the cost of books which suits your budget.As we grew, we diversified from just renting books
        online to a platform, where you can find all type of books- e.g. children books, academic and
        non-academic books and everything bookish under the sun. We pivoted from an online bookstore from where you buy
        books to a platform, which celebrate books and literature. Every pre-loved book is carefully inspected to ensure
        that you get value for money for your purchases.<br>
